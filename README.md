# Quotr #

Quotr is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) 
for getting near real-time stock quotes from [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/).
It works for pretty much every relevant ticker in the world (currently 26.626 symbols across the globe). The delay depends on the Yahoo's data provider. 
Normally it's 15 minutes. You can check the list of exchanges and their corresponding delays [here](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN2310.html).



# Installing #

Make sure you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), then... (you'll need `sudo` on linux boxes)

    npm install -g quotr
    
# Using #

Open the terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and type:

    quotr
    
Now you've entered the `quotr` shell.
    
For getting all available commands:

    help
    
For getting help for a specific command:

    <command> /?
    
Now you can start entering commands...

### `history` (short: `h`) ###

Displays the history for a given symbol. Examples:

    h aapl (displays the last 10 days history of the `aapl` symbol, which is the default in case no interval is specified)
    h aapl -l 60 (displays the last 60 days history for the `aapl` symbol)
    h aapl -f 2015-10-01 -t 2015-10-30 (displays the history for the `aapl` symbol from 2015-10-01 to 2015-10-30)
    
Currently, the `history` command does not take into account the current day until it's closed.
